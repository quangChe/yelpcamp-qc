#YelpCamp

YelpCamp was a project that I worked on while taking an online full-stack developer class by Colt Steele. My version of YelpCamp bonus features that were not covered in the class:

- Address input for campground posts
- Geolocation feature for provided address using Geocoder
- Google Maps API using data from Geocoder
- Facebook sharing for each campground

>A work in progress

Setup instructions will be added in the future as I am still planning on making further improvements to this program.

This project is currently up and running on [here](https://yelpcamp-qc.herokuapp.com). It is hosted on Heroku's servers and uses MongoLab as the database host.
